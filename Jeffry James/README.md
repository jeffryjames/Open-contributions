Three Types of Machine Learning : Supervised, Unsupervised and Reinforcement.

Supervised Machine Learning is an algorithm that learns from labeled training data to  predict outcomes for data.In Supervised learning we can train the machine using data that is labeled.

Unsupervised Learning Algorithms allow users to perform complex tasks compared to supervised learning.Unsupervised learning algorithms include clustering, anomaly detection and neural networks.

Reinforcement learning is about taking suitable action to maximize reward in a particular situation.It is employed by various software and machines to find the best possible behavior or path it should take in a specific situation.It differs from the supervised learning in a way that in supervised learning the training data has the answer key with it so the model is trained with the correct answer itself whereas in reinforcement learning, there is no answer but the reinforcement agent decides what to do to perform the given task. 

Linear Regression : Linear Regression is a machine learning algorithm based on supervised learning.Linear regression performs the task to predict a dependent variable value y based on a given independent variable x. So, this regression technique finds out a linear relationship between x (input) and y(output)
